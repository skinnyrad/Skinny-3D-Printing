```

## Usage

- Import the provided `.stl` (or other) files into your slicer of choice.
- Adjust printer profile, material, and supports as needed for your specific machine.
- Refer to each subdirectory’s `README.md` for recommended settings and assembly notes.

## Contributing

- Create a new folder under `Models/` for each project.
- Include:
  - A `README.md` with a short description, any assembly note or print recommendations, and an image or render of the design.
  - Model files (`.stl` and other optional files `.3mf`, `.obj`, etc.).
  - Images of the design (not required if your image is embedded in the README).
- Keep filenames descriptive (for example, `device_case_top_v2.stl`).
- Refer to the `UbertoothCase` project as an example.
