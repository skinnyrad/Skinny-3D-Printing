Currently, only a snap-fit case is in the repository, with a nut-bolt hardware closed version coming soon. 

The STL should work with any slicer, however it will not have color information.  The 3MF was created in Bambu slicer, and will have the text as separate bodies that you can color separately if you'd like.

When assembling the snap-fit case, place your ubertooth on the "lid" first, aligning the mounting posts with the screw-holes in the board (make sure to have the board on the correct side so that the LED's will shine through the holes in the lid). Once snug, while upside down, put the bottom part of the case on top of the board and lid.  Flip it over, and press down on the lid where the two snaps are located, there is one on either side of the long sides of the case. There are small indentions in the lid of the case where the snaps click in.

Below are images of the snap-fit case
